About me
========
I was born in the southern plains of Nepal. Having experienced acute power cuts in my school days, growing up I was captivated by the idea of how the non-perennial resources such as wind, solar, and hydro could be leveraged to meet the energy demand across the globe in a sustainable way.

After completing my four years Bachelors degree in India and working in biogas and solar sector of Nepal for a couple of years, I received the prestigious DAAD scholarship to pursue Masters in Renewable Energy Management from Cologne University of Applied Sciences.

Work
====
Currently working as an energy and climate policy analyst at [Climate Analytics](https://www.climateanalytics.org) based in Berlin, my reserch focuses on developing energy system models for countries and regions, assessing the national policy targets of countries against 1.5 C compatible pathways, and assessing the implications of Paris Agreement compatible long-term energy scenarios on the energy system transformation.

Research Interests
======
I love writing at the intersection of data science with energy, climate change and sustainability. I try to be as simple as possible with my words. My main research interests include but not limited to data science, energy system modelling, sector coupling, and integration of renewable energy in the power systems.

Hobbies
======
I have been a fan of Football Club Barcelona for more than a decade now, and I rarely miss watching their weekly matches. Besides, I love travelling (I have visited about 20 countries till date), walking in parks, and visiting museums.
